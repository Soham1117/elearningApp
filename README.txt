Database setup:
1. We have used MySql Workbench 8.0 for our local database.
2. We have set it up using the following credentials:
    host = "localhost" port="3306" user="root" password="Soham123!" database="sys"
3. Change these credentials in the "user_dao.py" file if there are differences in your database setup.

Compiling and running the application.
1. Install Python 3.11.5 for Windows or Mac.
2. Unzip the elearningApp.zip.
3. Open command prompt in the elearningApp directory OR cd 'full_path/elearningApp'.
4. Run this command for installing the necessary modules: pip install -r requirements.txt.
5. Run this command to execute the application: python/python3 main.py (Make sure to setup database first.)
